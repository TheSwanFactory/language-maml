# language-maml
MAML is the [Multipurpose Abstract Markup Language](https://theswanfactory.com/2016/11/08/introducing-maml-a-draft-proposal-for-html6/).

This repository is an [Atom package](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/) providing syntax highlighting and other tools for working with MAML in Atom.

This package is inspired by, but not actually derived from, the Atom [CoffeeScript package](https://github.com/atom/language-coffee-script).
